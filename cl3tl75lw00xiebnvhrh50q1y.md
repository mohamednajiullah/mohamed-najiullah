## Slippery Slope of Negativity

The more you dislike someone, the easier it is for you to dislike them even more. 

The lesser you trust someone, the easier it is for you to trust them even less. 

The inherent negative bias of our brains combined with a primitive desire to see the world in black and white is truly frightening. What's more frightening is that this happens subconsciously, without you realising it. 

So the next time you find yourself disliking or mistrusting someone or something, try to remember where it started. You might just find out that you are being unfair.
