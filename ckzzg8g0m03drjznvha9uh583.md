## Everything has Context

In any long running software development project, there'll always be a point where we question past choices. Some of those choices can appear downright stupid just a few years later, especially to those who were not there when those choices were made.

While it should be obvious that this is how life also works, people forget this and need to be reminded from time to time.

If you know someone who you think has made some bad choices in the past, remember to look beyond those choices and into what they were going through at that time. It'll help you become more empathetic and also support them when they need it the most.

P.S: As I always say, if you have made some bad choices in the past, help others not repeat your mistakes.
