## Prime Directive for Life?

Have you heard of retrospective prime directive?

An important element of Agile is having retrospective meetings after a period of time (sprint/iteration). The facilitator of a retrospective meeting usually starts the meeting reading out the prime directive which goes like this

"Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand".

I honestly think that this piece of wisdom should not be restricted to just retrospectives.

Why not start the day saying this to ourselves? It might just help us be more empathetic to others.

Thoughts?
