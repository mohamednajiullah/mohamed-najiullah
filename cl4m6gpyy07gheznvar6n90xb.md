## Help Others to Help You

If you need help, make it easy for others to help you.

For example, if you are raising some money for a cause, make it easy for people to donate. Everything else being equal, you have more chances of raising money by sharing a UPI QR code than by sharing bank account details.

Why? Because it takes less time to setup a transfer with a QR code than with bank details in text.

Take away the friction to help you and you'll find a lot more helpful people.
