## Build or Destroy

Sometimes, when you are working with younger colleagues/teammates, you might feel that they don't know something that you think they should know based on their experience or skillset.

Instead of asking them, "why don't you know this?", ask yourself "How can I help them learn this?".

This could be the difference between shattering their confidence and, creating a team culture of learning and growth.

Choose the latter and see the difference it makes.
