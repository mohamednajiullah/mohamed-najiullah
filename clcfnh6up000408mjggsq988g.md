# Not all pain is bad.

A relative of mine had an accident. He got knocked down by a bus while he was waiting to cross the road and fractured his wrist.

Being afraid of expensive treatment, he went to a traditional medicine man who helped set it back but left it misaligned. It became apparent after some time that the misalignment made the hand look crooked. It also became painful to do certain actions because of it.

When he went to another doctor, he was advised to get his wrist realigned to correct the appearance and relieve his pain. He agreed to it but when he found out that it involved breaking the bone again, he backed out. He considered it too painful and couldn't bring himself to do it. Instead, he decided to live with the pain.

And so, he has been suffering. For the last 30 years.

He regrets not having the courage to endure some pain for a short while so that he could have had a better quality of life for the rest of his life.

From what I know of people, we all have pains like this. If you are reading this, think of all the things that you've been avoiding because they may cause short-term pain. And think of how much better your life would be if you act now.

This new year, I hope you get the courage to do what's necessary.
